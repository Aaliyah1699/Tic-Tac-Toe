🌔How I want the game to work
----------------------------------------------------
-> want user to chose either X or O by clicking on the option
->when they chose the letter they want and click on one of the boxes that letter will sit inside the box
-> once one gets three in a row no more boxes can be filled 
-> if neither wins a tie announcement pops up on screen
-> the winner pops on screen when they get three in a row
-> the board resets when the reset button is clicked 
-> after reset they can choose another letter and play again
