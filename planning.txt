------------------------------------------------------
🌔How I want the game to work
----------------------------------------------------
-> want user to chose either X or O by clicking on the option
->when they chose the letter they want and click on one of the boxes that letter will sit inside the box
-> once one gets three in a row no more boxes can be filled 
-> if neither wins a tie announcement pops up on screen
-> the winner pops on screen when they get three in a row
-> the board resets when the reset button is clicked 
-> after reset they can choose another letter and play again
-------------------------------------------------------
🌓Later
--------------------------------------------------------
⭐️(going to add AI to game later to play with computer)⭐️
-> When player 1 (user) choses X or O player 2 (AI) will automatically be the other 
-> Player 1 (user) goes first and marks the cell they want 
-> after Player 2 (AI) will automatically click/ pick a random cell that is not taken and mark that cell
-> If player 1 (user) gets 3 in a row no more cells can be picked and player 2 (AI) will not be able to pick another cell and the game will end and winners announced
-> Same when reversed
-> If neither player 1 or player 2 gets 3 in a row then it's a tie and the tie message will show 
-> when the game is reset AI will wait until player 1 makes a move
